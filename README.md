## The Code

This is a React Native implementation of Standard Notes. React Native allows us to build native mobile applications using JavaScript. This allows us to develop faster, as well as have a more reliable and consistent cross-platform experience.

### Building the Project

Clone the project, then initialize the project with required files:

1. `yarn init`
3. `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

Note: You may need to set up an SSH key on GitHub to pull in submodules. Please follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) to do so.

If upon building Android you see the error "Could not get unknown property 'repositoryUrl' for project ':ReactAndroid'", please edit the file in `node_modules/react-native/ReactAndroid/release.gradle` according to [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43967489/could-not-get-unknown-property-repositoryurl-for-project).

### Running on Device

- For iOS:
    Open the project in Xcode, then simply build and run with your device selected.
- For Android: connect your device, then simply run `react-native run-android`

### Generating an APK

```
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

You'll then find the APK in this directory:
> android/app/build/outputs/apk/release

## Contributing
Before contributing, please read our [Longevity Statement](https://standardnotes.org/longevity) to better understand how we approach adding new features. Unlike other projects, adding new features is something we prefer *not* to do, so if you have a feature which you think is absolutely essential, please create a discussion issue first before coding.
